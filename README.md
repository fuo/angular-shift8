Angular.js Extras by Shift8Creative

All the relevant files to include into your project are in the `modules` directory.
The rest of the files here are used for GitHub pages...I decided to include this in the master branch
to not only make my life easier between branches and testing, but also to allow you to load the examples
and documentation locally when you clone this repository.

If you want, yank out the modules directory by itself (everything you need is in there) or just ignore
all the other files - there really should be no problem with having them in your project. All example
files should be contained to the `demo` directory except for the html pages which will be in the root.
